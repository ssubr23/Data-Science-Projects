# Defect Detection and Localization in Steel Manufacturing

## Case Study Overview

In this case study, I assume the role of an AI/ML consultant. I have been hired by a steel manufacturing company in San Diego to automate the process of detecting and localizing defects found in steel manufacturing. Detecting defects will help in improving the quality of manufacturing as well as in reducing waste due to production defects.

## Project Description

I have been provided with a dataset consisting of 12,600 images of steel surfaces. These images contain four types of defects, along with their locations on the steel surface. My task is to develop a model capable of detecting and localizing these defects in real-time.

## Data Science Methods Used

The data science method used for this project is ResUNet, a deep learning model well-suited for image segmentation tasks. This model will help in accurately identifying and localizing defects on the steel surfaces.

## Objectives

- Automate the defect detection and localization process in steel manufacturing.
- Improve the quality of manufacturing by identifying defects early in the process.
- Reduce waste caused by production defects by providing real-time defect localization.

## Conclusion

This project aims to leverage advanced AI/ML techniques to enhance the steel manufacturing process, ensuring higher quality and efficiency.
