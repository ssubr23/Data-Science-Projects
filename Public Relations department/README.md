# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

## Overview
I work as a data scientist at a multinational corporation. The Public Relations department has collected extensive data on our customers, including product reviews. Based on these reviews (in text format), the team wants to predict whether customers are satisfied with the product or not.

## Objective
The main goal is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and predict their satisfaction levels.

## Data
- **Source:** Customer product reviews.
- **Format:** Text.

## Methods
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Employed to process and analyze textual data.

## Usage
This project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The steps to reproduce the analysis are as follows:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather product reviews from the provided dataset.
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data to prepare it for analysis.
3. **Model Training:** Use NLP techniques to build and train a model that can predict customer satisfaction.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn, nltk, etc.
