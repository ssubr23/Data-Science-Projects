Explanation of Data Science Concepts:
Data Loading and Overview:

Loading the dataset and displaying basic information using info() and describe() to understand the structure and statistics of the data.
Missing Values:

Visualizing missing data using a heatmap.
Filling missing values in the 'MINIMUM_PAYMENTS' and 'CREDIT_LIMIT' columns with their respective mean values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing the distribution of each feature using histograms and KDE plots.
Creating a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing:

Standardizing the data using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.
Clustering:

Using the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting inertia (sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned cluster center).
Applying KMeans clustering and interpreting cluster centers.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data for visualization purposes.
Visualizing the clusters in 2D space using scatter plots.
Autoencoder:

Building an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction to capture the most significant features of the data.
Comparing clustering performance on the original data and the encoded (compressed) data using the Elbow Method and PCA visualization.
