## Case Study Overview

I have been hired as a consultant by a bank in New York City. The bank has collected extensive data on their customers over the past 6 months. The marketing team at the bank aims to launch a targeted advertising campaign by dividing their customers into at least three distinctive groups. 

## Objectives

- Analyze customer data to identify distinct segments.
- Use data science techniques to categorize customers for targeted marketing.

## Techniques Used

- **K-Means Clustering:** This technique is used to partition the customers into distinct groups based on their similarities.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to visualize and interpret the clustering results.
