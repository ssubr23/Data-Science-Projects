# Employee Attrition Prediction Model

## Overview

I work as a data scientist at a multinational corporation. Recently, the HR team approached me with an extensive dataset they had collected on their employees. They tasked me with developing a model that could predict which employees are more likely to quit.

## Dataset

The HR team provided a comprehensive dataset that includes various features related to employee engagement and satisfaction. Here is a sample of the dataset:

- **JobInvolvement**
- **Education**
- **JobSatisfaction**
- **PerformanceRating**
- **RelationshipSatisfaction**
- **WorkLifeBalance**

## Objective

The objective of this project is to utilize the provided data to develop a predictive model that identifies employees who are at a higher risk of quitting. By doing so, the HR team can proactively address potential issues and improve employee retention.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning the dataset
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing/standardizing features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing the distribution of each feature
   - Analyzing correlations between features
   - Identifying significant patterns related to employee attrition

3. **Model Development**
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms
   - Training the model
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Cross-validation to ensure model robustness
   
## Models used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Artifical Neural network


## Conclusion

By developing this predictive model, I aim to provide the HR team with valuable insights that can help them understand the factors influencing employee attrition. With this information, they can take targeted actions to improve employee satisfaction and retention, ultimately benefiting the organization as a whole.
