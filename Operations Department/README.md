# Chest X-Ray Disease Detection and Classification

## Project Overview

AI/ML/DL has been revolutionizing healthcare and medicine by significantly impacting areas such as medical imagery, drug research, and genome development. Deep learning, in particular, has been proven to be superior in detecting and classifying diseases using imagery data.

In this case study, I will assume the role of a Deep Learning Consultant. I have been hired by a hospital in downtown Toronto and tasked to automate the process of detecting and classifying chest diseases to reduce the cost and time of detection. The team has collected extensive X-Ray chest data and approached me to develop a model that could detect and classify the diseases in less than 1 minute.

## Data

I have been provided with 133 images that belong to 4 classes:
- Healthy
- Covid-19
- Bacterial Pneumonia
- Viral Pneumonia

## Results

The project includes the following key results:

- Chest X-ray disease detection and classification model.
- Analysis of model performance and evaluation metrics.
- Insights into the effectiveness of deep learning in medical imagery.
