# Sales Prediction Using AI/ML

## Project Overview

To help companies become competitive and skyrocket their growth, I am leveraging AI/ML to develop predictive models to forecast future sales. These predictive models forecast sales based on historical data while taking into account seasonality effects, demand, holidays, promotions, and competition.

In this project, I am working as a data scientist in the sales department, utilizing data provided by the sales team from 1115 stores. The objective is to predict future daily sales based on various features.

## Tools and Technologies

I am using Prophet, an open-source software released by Facebookâ€™s Core Data Science team, to develop these predictive models.

## Objectives

- Develop predictive models to forecast future sales.
- Analyze historical sales data.
- Consider factors such as seasonality, demand, holidays, promotions, and competition in the forecasting models.

## Data

The dataset provided contains information from 1115 stores, including historical sales data and various features relevant to sales forecasting.
