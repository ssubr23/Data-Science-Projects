Purpose:
For companies to become competitive and skyrocket their growth, they need to leverage AI/ML to develop predictive models to forecast sales in the future.
Predictive models attempt at forecasting future sales based on historical data while taking into account seasonality effects, demand, holidays, promotions, and competition.
In this project, as a data scientist the objective is to predict future daily sales based on the features.

Data Science concepts:

Data Loading
Reading Data: Loading datasets into pandas DataFrames allows for easy manipulation and analysis. Common formats include CSV files.
Data Exploration
Head and Tail: Viewing the first and last few rows of the dataset helps understand its structure and identify potential issues.
Info and Describe: info() provides a concise summary of the DataFrame including data types and non-null counts, while describe() gives descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Identifying and dealing with missing data is crucial. This can involve filling missing values with mean/median values, zeros, or dropping rows/columns with missing data.
Feature Extraction: Adding new features based on existing data, such as extracting year, month, and day from a date column, can provide additional insights for analysis and modeling.
Data Visualization
Histograms: Useful for understanding the distribution of numerical features.
Heatmaps: Visual representation of missing data or correlations between variables.
Line Plots and Bar Plots: Visualizing trends and patterns over time or across categories, such as average sales per month or customer count variations.
Data Merging
Combining DataFrames: Merging datasets based on a common key (e.g., Store ID) to create a comprehensive dataset that includes all relevant information.
Correlation Analysis
Correlation Matrix: Identifying relationships between variables helps in understanding which features are most influential in predicting the target variable.
Time Series Analysis
Prophet Model: A time series forecasting tool used to predict future values based on historical data. It can handle seasonality, holidays, and trends.
Holiday Effects: Incorporating holidays into the model can improve forecast accuracy by accounting for variations in sales due to holidays.
Feature Engineering
Creating New Features: Adding new columns derived from existing data, such as the day of the week or month, which can capture seasonal effects and trends.
Model Evaluation
Visualizing Predictions: Plotting the predicted values against actual values helps assess the model's performance.
Model Components: Analyzing the components of the forecast (trend, seasonality, holiday effects) provides insights into how the model makes predictions.
